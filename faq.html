					<p>How can I get an APK File?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-body">
					<p>
					You can download both apps from the Google Play store. You will then need
					to extract the APK - we'd suggest using APK Extractor. You can then send
					the APK to your computer from your phone. Alternatively, Sonic Retro keeps
					an archive of APK versions.

				<div class="faq-header">
					<p>How do I install and patch S1F & S2A?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-body">
					<p>
					Copy the files in the download into your game folder, and rerun the setup script, pressing Y when prompted. We've worked to make this as simple a process as possible, automating wherever we can. New releases should preserve your save files when patched in, too.

				<div class="faq-header">
					<p>Will S1F & S2A work with a data.RSDK file?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-body">
					<p>
					Yes. The easy setup will check the install folder for a file called "data.rsdk". If it finds one, it will extract the game assets from this without requiring an APK file.

				<div class="faq-header">
					<p>Are the games compatible with operating systems other than Windows?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-body">
					<p>
					Currently, our easy setup process is only for Windows, however our stand-alone mods may function with installations of the decomps on other systems. Please note, this is untested, and some features may not work as expected.

					<p>Where can I report bugs or seek technical help?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-body">
					<p>
					The best way is via email at teamforeverhelp@gmail.com.<br><br>Alternatively we do try to monitor YouTube and Bluesky comments, but there is a higher risk of us missing a question there.

				<div class="faq-header">
					<p>Where can I find or submit mods?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-body">
					<p>
					There are pages dedicated to mods for S1F and S2A over at GameBanana. However, due to ongoing concerns with this website, we do not advise using GB for hosting or acquiring mods currently.

				<div class="faq-header">
					<p>How do I use mods?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-body">
					<p>
					The easy setup will create a mods folder (or you can do this yourself). Put extracted mods in this folder, and navigate to the mods list from the main menu. You can activate and deactivate the mods here.

					<p>I have save files from the original decomp that don't show. Where are they?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-body">
					<p>
					S1F & S2A use a different place in the SaveRAM to save games. This means that any saved games you already have on the base decomp can't be found.<br><br>Pressing the up button five times on the SEGA splash screen will copy any base decomp saves found to our custom save slots.

					<p>Where did the Team Forever Twitter account go?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-body">
					<p>
					Team Forever have chosen to move away from Twitter as a platform. All new updates will be posted, as they always have, on this site. Additional announcements, trailers and sneak peeks can be found at our YouTube page at https://www.youtube.com/@teamforeverdev and our Tumblr page at https://www.tumblr.com/teamforever.

				<div class="faq-header">
					<p>Are these games compatible with Sonic Origins?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-body">
					<p>
					Sonic 1 Forever and Sonic 2 Absolute do not support the Origins versions of their respective game, due to being different in a few aspects. 'UNANNOUNCED TEAM FOREVER CD PROJECT' is a full, hand-made port of Sonic CD using the existing decomps of both Sonic CD 2011 and Sonic 1 2013 as a base along with some code from the Origins-specific iterations.

				<div class="faq-header">
					<p>Why can't I access Knuckles or Amy's alternative moveset in 'UNANNOUNCED TEAM FOREVER CD PROJECT'?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-body">
					<p>
					This is due to concerns we have with SEGA and potential possibility of a takedown. By default, the game will detect if you own it on Steam, and if you do, the game will unlock Knuckles and Amy's Origins moveset. The game and it's DLC go on sale quite often, so try to pick it up when that happens!
